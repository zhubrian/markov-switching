Title:

Regime-switching factor models for cryptocurrencies

Abstract:

In this paper, we consider a Markov regime-switching factor model with the goal of explaining asset returns while considering cyclical patterns present in the market. To estimate the modelâ€™s parameters, we formulate an expectation-maximization algorithm that entirely relies on running forward-backward procedures and linear regressions. The model and algorithm are empirically tested on cryptocurrency data over the past year with a three-factor model. The results suggest that a moderate number of regimes are optimal based on the Bayesian information criterion and that our algorithm has desirable properties, while providing another interpretation of explained asset returns via regime-dependent parameters.
